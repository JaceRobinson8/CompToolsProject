Twitter is an online social networking service that allows users to send and read short messages. Users are able to communicate primarily through tweets, retweets, follows, and hashtags. A tweet is a 140 characters or less message, an image, or a short video uploaded by a user. A retweet is when one user forwards another user’s tweet to all his or her followers. When a user follows another user, he or she is able to see all tweets and retweets of that user. Through the use of hashtags, the symbol ‘#’ and a message, users are able to connect through specific user defined moments. Through these four primary functions, Twitter has grown to have 320 million active users per month [1]. If enough users hashtag the same topic, it becomes a trending topic for all to see on the front page of Twitter. This social network has become one of the Internet gateways to global culture. Famous actors, presidential candidates, local celebrities and your average Joe are all connected on Twitter. 

Data for this project will come from three sources. The first is the Twitter REST API. This API’s primary role is to collect more-filtered, old data. The second source is the Twitter Streaming API to collect less-filtered live data. There are API rate limits which determine the amount of information minable. By writing short scripts in Python, I will be able to use these API’s to collect rich data. This data will provide access to attributes such as location of user, location of tweet, time posted, relationships between users, and the content of user’s interests. The third source is a large network database already collected by Stanford’s SNAP! project showing the enormous social circles within Twitter [2]. Each of the three data sources will be used to answer different questions. 

In this project I will present various ‘compare and contrast’ stories from the collected data. These comparisons will seek to give insight into the patterns of common characteristics between different user bases. For example I want to compare samples of followers’ between Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump accounts. Questions about the followers such as home location twitter usage, tweeting topics, and other following accounts may produce striking trends. Following standard political lines, I would hypothesize Trump followers to follow conservative related accounts while Clinton followers to follow more liberal accounts. Similar comparisons can be made for rival sports figures, rival eSports figures, and differing comedy accounts. Additional trends may be found when comparing small niche groups such as a popular local music groups against larger mainstream figures. In the small groups, I would expect each individual user to tweet more often on average while the larger group would have primarily passive followers. Through the examination of the Stanford Network data set, big picture connections between various social groups can be established. I will study two extremely unrelated groups and find a short topic-to-topic path to connect the two. I would expect the distance between the groups to be surprisingly small. Thanks to the vast popularity of Twitter, finding the answers for these questions will lead to an educational adventure in global culture.
